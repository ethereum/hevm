# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## Added
- Allow dumping unsolved SMT files via `--dump-unsolved`
- Allow resolving unknown addresses to only those that are already deployed
  via option `--only-deployed`
- New empty solver option that simply makes sure that all SMT queries return
  unknown
- Allow `verifyInputs` to return partial expressions
- Counterexamples are now validated when running in `hevm test` mode

## Fixed
- We now extract more Keccak computations than before from the Props to assert
  more Keccak equalities.
- Faster word256Bytes and word160Bytes functions to help concrete execution
  performance

## Changed
- Updated forge to 1.2.3 and forge-std to 60acb7aa (1.9.7+)
- We now gather Keccak axioms during `setUp()` and inject them into the SMT solver.
  This helps us finding more correct Keccak preimages

## [0.55.1] - 2025-07-22

## Added
- When a staticcall is made to a contract that does not exist, we overapproximate
  and return symbolic values
- More simplification rules for Props
- JoinBytes simplification rule
- New simplification rule to help deal with abi.encodeWithSelector
- More simplification rules for Props
- Using the SMT solver to get a single concrete value for a symbolic expression
  and continue running, whenever possible
- STATICCALL abstraction is now performed in case of symbolic arguments
- Better error messages for JSON parsing
- Multiple solutions are allowed for a single symbolic expression, and they are
  generated via iterative calls to the SMT solver for quicker solving
- Aliasing works much better for symbolic and concrete addresses
- Constant propagation for symbolic values
- Allow reading bytecode via --code-file or --code-a-file/--code-b-file. Strips
  `\n`, spaces, and ignores leading `0x` to make it easier to use via e.g.
  `jq '.deplayedBytecode.object file.json > file.txt'` to parse Forge JSON output
  This alleviates the issue when the contract is large and does not fit the command line
  limit of 8192 characters
- Two more simplification rules: `ReadByte` & `ReadWord` when the `CopySlice`
  it is reading from is writing after the position being read, so the
  `CopySlice` can be ignored
- More simplification rules that help avoid symbolic copyslice in case of
  STATICCALL overapproximation
- Test to make sure we don't accidentally overapproximate a working, good STATICCALL
- Allow EXTCODESIZE/HASH, BALANCE to be abstracted to a symbolic value.
- Allow CALL to be extracted in case `--promise-no-reent` is given, promising
  no reentrancy of contracts. This may skip over reentrancy vulnerabilities
  but allows much more thorough exploration of the contract
- Allow controlling the max buffer sizes via --max-buf-size to something smaller than 2**64
  so we don't get too large buffers as counterexamples
- More symbolic overapproximation for Balance and ExtCodeHash opcodes, fixing
  CodeHash SMT representation
- Add deployment code flag to the `equivalenceCheck` function
- PNeg + PGT/PGEq/PLeq/PLT simplification rules
- We no longer dispatch Props to SMT that can be solved by a simplification
- Allow user to change the verbosity level via `--verb`. For the moment, this is only to
  print some warnings related to zero-address dereference and to print `hemv test`'s
  output in case of failure
- Simple test cases for the CLI
- Allow limiting the branch depth and width limitation via --max-depth and --max-width
- When there are zero solutions to a multi-solution query it means that the
  currently executed branch is in fact impossible. In these cases, unwind all
  frames and return a Revert with empty returndata.
- More rewrite rules for PEq, PNeg, missing eqByte call, and distributivity for And
- Allow changing of the prefix from "prove" via --prefix in `test` mode
- More complete simplification during interpretation
- SMT-based resolving of addresses now works for delegatecall and staticcall
  opcodes as well
- UNSAT cache is now in `Solvers.hs` and is therefore shared across all threads.
  Hence, it is now active even during branch queries.
- Rewrite rule to deal with some forms of argument packing by Solidity
  via masking
- More rewrite rules for (PLT (Lit 0) _) and (PEq (Lit 1) _)
- Simplification can now be turned off from the cli via --no-simplify
- When doing Keccak concretization, and simplification is enabled,
  we do both until fixedpoint
- When gathering Keccak axioms, we simplify the bytestring that
  the keccak is applied to
- More rewrite rules for MulMod, AddMod, SHL, SHR, SLT, and SignExtend
- PLEq is now concretized in case it can be computed
- More SignExtend test cases
- Rewrite rules to deal with specific exponentiation patterns
- Added missing simplification and concretization of the SAR instruction

## Fixed
- We now try to simplify expressions fully before trying to cast them to a concrete value
  This should improve issues when "Unexpected Symbolic Arguments to Opcode" was
  unnecessarily output
- Not all testcases ran due to incorrect filtering, fixed
- Removed dead code related to IOAct in the now deprecated and removed debugger
- Base case of exponentiation to 0 was not handled, leading to infinite loop
- Better exponential simplification
- Dumping of END states (.prop) files is now default for `--debug`
- When cheatcode is missing, we produce a partial execution warning
- Size of calldata can be up to 2**64, not 256. This is now reflected in the documentation
- We now have less noise during test runs, and assert more about symbolic copyslice tests
- CopySlice rewrite rule is now less strict while still being sound
- Assumptions about reading from buffer after its size are now the same in all cases.
  Previously, they were too weak in case of reading 32 bytes.
- The equivalence checker now is able to prove that an empty store is
  equivalent to a store with all slots initialized to 0.
- Equivalence checking was incorrectly assuming that overapproximated values
  were sequentially equivalent. We now distinguish these symbolic values with
  `A-` and `B-`
- Buffer of all zeroes was interpreted as an empty buffer during parsing SMT model.
  The length of the buffer is now properly taken into account.
- It was possible to enter an infinite recursion when trying to shrink a buffer found by
  the SMT solver. We now properly detect that it is not possible to shrink the buffer.
- Pretty printing of buffers is now more robust. Instead of throwing an `internal error`,
  we now try best to print everything we can, and print an appropriate error message
  instead of crashing.
- We no longer produce duplicate SMT assertions regarding concrete keccak values.
- Ord is now correctly implemented for Prop.
- Signed and unsigned integers have more refined ranges.
- Symbolic interpretation of assertGe/Gt/Le/Lt over signed integers now works correctly.
- SignExtend is now correctly being constant-folded
- Some of our property-based testing was ineffective because of inadvertent
  simplification  happening before calling the SMT solver. This has now been fixed.
- When pranking an address, we used the non-pranked address' nonce
  to calculate the new address. This was incorrect, and lead to address clash,
  as the nonce was never incremented.
- We only report FAIL in `test` mode for assertion failures that match the
  string prefix "assertion failed", or match function selector Panic(uint256)
  with a parameter 0x1. Previously, `require(a==b, "reason")` was a cause for
  FAIL in case a!=b was possible. This has now been fixed.
- Out of bounds reads could occur in Haskell when trying to determine
  valid jump destinations. This has now been fixed.

## Changed
- Warnings now lead printing FAIL. This way, users don't accidentally think that
  their contract is correct when there were cases/branches that hevm could not
  fully explore. Printing of issues is also now much more organized
- Expressions that are commutative are now canonicalized to have the smaller
  value on the LHS. This can significantly help with simplifications, automatically
  determining when (Eq a b) is true when a==b modulo commutativity
- `hevm test`'s flag ` --verbose` is now `--verb`, which also increases verbosity
  for other elements of the system
- Add `--arrays-exp` to cvc5 options.
- We now use Options.Applicative and a rather different way of parsing CLI options.
  This should give us much better control over the CLI options and their parsing.
- block.number can now be symbolic. This only affects library use of hevm
- Removed `--smtoutput` since it was never used
- We now build with -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 libff, as cmake deprecated 3.5
- CheckSatResult has now been unified with ProofResult via SMTResult
- If counterexample would require a buffer that's larger than 1GB, we abandon
  shrinking it.
- If solver is not able to solve a query while attempting to shrink the model, we
  abandon the attempt gracefully instead of crashing with internal error.
- Buffers are now handled more lazily when inspecting a model, which avoids some
  unnecesary internal errors.
- EVM memory is now grown on demand using a 2x factor, to avoid repeated smaller
  increases which hurt concrete execution performance due to their linear cost.
- The concrete MCOPY implementation has been optimized to avoid freezing the whole
  EVM memory.
- We no longer accept `check` as a prefix for test cases by default.
- The way we print warnings for `symbolic` mode now matches that of `test` mode.

## [0.54.2] - 2024-12-12

  partial results instead of erroring out
- Fix interpreter's MCOPY handling so that it doesn't error out on symbolic arguments
- More desciptive errors in case of a cheatcode issue
- Better and more pretty debug messages
- Many env* cheatcodes are now supported

## Fixed
- `vm.prank` is now respected during calls to create
- `concat` is a 2-ary, not an n-ary function in SMT2LIB, declare-const does not exist in QF_AUFBV, replacing
   with declare-fun
- CVC5 needs `--incremental` flag to work properly in abstraction-refinement mode
- cli.hs now uses with-utf8 so no release binary will have locale issues anymore
- Took ideas for simplification rules from "Super-optimization of Smart Contracts" paper by Albert et al.
- Printing panic uint256 as hex, not as int
- Decomposition does not take place when entire states are compared, as that would necessitate
  a different approach.
- `initial-storage` option of `hevm symbolic` is respected

- Fixed bug in SMT encoding that caused empty and all-zero byte arrays to be considered equal
  and hence lead to false negatives through trivially UNSAT SMT expressions
- Respect --smt-timeout in equivalence checking
- Fixed the handling of returndata with an abstract size during transaction finalization
- Error handling for user-facing cli commands is much improved
- Fixed call signature generation for test cases
- Fixing prank so it doesn't override the sender address on lower call frames

## [0.53.0] - 2024-02-23

## Changed

- Minimum distance requirements are now asserted for Keccak function calls. They assert that it's hard to generate two Keccak's that are less than 256 afar.
- Keccak concretization is now done only after all simplifications are performed. This helps with simplification pre-concretization
- Added an IllegalOverflow error in case the system tries to allocate a large amount of memory during
  abstract gas execution but concrete running. In these cases, the interpreter can out-of-heap
  as the only check is that the size allocated is less than $2**{64}$, but that is too large to fit in memory. Now,
  we check more stringently, and still return an IllegalOverflow
- Fixed `--root` option for the `test` subcommand
- Use `-Wunused-packages` and eliminate unused deps.

## Added

  and further solc-specific simplifications of Expr
- Simplify earlier and don't check reachability for things statically determined to be FALSE
- New concrete fuzzer that can be controlled via `--num-cex-fuzz`
- Partial support for dynamic jumps when the jump destination can be computed
  given already available information
- Added three forking cheatcodes: `createFork`, `selectFork`, and `activeFork`

## Fixed

- Traces now correctly perform source mapping to display contract details
- Event traces now correctly display indexed arguments and argument names
- JSON reading of foundry JSONs was dependent on locale and did not work with many locales.

## [0.52.0] - 2023-10-26

This is a major breaking release that removes several user facing features and includes non trivial
breakage for library users. These changes mean the code is significantly simpler, more performant,
and allow support for new features like fully symbolic addresses.

In addition to the changes below, this release includes significant work on performance
optimization for symbolic execution.

## Added

The major new user facing feature in this release is support for fully symbolic addresses (including
fully symbolic addresses for deployed contracts). This allows tests to be writen that call
`vm.prank` with a symbolic value, making some tests (e.g. access control, token transfer logic) much
more comprehensive.

Some restrictions around reading balances from and transfering value between symbolic addresses are
currently in place. Currently, if the address is symbolic, then you will only be able to read it's
balance, or transfer value to/from it, if it is the address of a contract that is actually deployed.
This is required to ensure soundness in the face of aliasing between symbolic addresses. We intend
to lift this restriction in a future release.

### Other

- Support for `vm.deal`
- Support for `vm.assume` (this is semantically identical to using `require`, but does simplify the
    process of porting exisitng fuzz tests to be symbolic)
- the `check` prefix now recognized for symbolic tests
- `hevm test` now takes a `--number` argument to specify which block should be used when making rpc queries

## Changed

### Revert Semantics in Solidity Tests

solidity tests no longer consider reverts to be a failure, and check only for the ds-test failed bit
or user defined assertion failures (i.e. `Panic(0x01)`). This makes writing tests much easier as
users no longer have to consider trivial reverts (e.g. arithmetic overflow).

A positive (i.e. `prove`/`check`) test with no rechable assertion violations that does not have any
succesful branches will still be considered a failure.

## Removed

hevm has been around for a while, and over time has accumulated many features. We decided to remove
some of these features in the interest of focusing our attention, increasing our iteration speed and
simplifying maintainance. The following user facing features have been removed from this release:

- The visual debugger has been removed
- All concrete ds-test executors have been removed (i.e. plain, fuzzer, invariant)
- Rpc caching and state serialization has been removed (i.e. all `--cache` / `--state` flags)
- The various `DAPP_TEST` variables are no longer observed
- The `--initial-storage` flag no longer accepts a concrete prestore (valid values are now `Empty` or `Abstract`)

## Fixed

This release also includes many small bugfixes:

- CopySlice wraparound issue especially during CopyCallBytesToMemory
- Contracts deployed during symbolic execution are created with an empty storage (instead of abstract in previous versions)
- EVM.Solidity.toCode to include contractName in error string
- Better cex reconstruction in cases where branches do not refer to all input variables in calldata
- Correctly handle empty bytestring compiled contracts' JSON
- No more false positives when keccak is called with inputs of different sizes
- `test` now falls back to displaying an unecoded bytestring for calldata when the model returned by the solver has a different length the length of the arguments in the test signature.
- we now generate correct counterexamples for branches where only a subset of input variables are referenced by the path conditions
- `vm.prank` now works correctly when passed a symbolic address
- `vm.prank` now works correctly when the next call transfers value
- storage layout information will now be parsed from the output of `forge build` if it is available

## API Changes

### Reworked Storage Model / Symbolic Addresses

Adding symbolic addresses required some fairly significant changes to the way that we model storage.
We introduced a new address type to `Expr` (`Expr EAddr`), that allows us to model fully symbolic
addresses. Instead of modelling storage as a global symbolic 2D map (`address -> word -> word`) in
`vm.env`, each contract now has it's own symbolic 1D map (`word -> word`), that is stored in the
`vm.contracts` mapping. `vm.contracts` is now keyed on `Expr EAddr` instead of `Addr`. Addresses
that are keys to the `vm.contracts` mapping are asserted to be distinct in our smt encoding. This
allows us to support symbolic addresses in a fully static manner (i.e. we do not currently need to
make any extra smt queries when looking up storage for a symbolic address).

### Mutable Memory & ST

We now use a mutable representation of memory if it is currently completely concrete. This is a
significant performance improvement, and fixed a particulary egregious memory leak. It does entail
the use of the `ST` monad, and introduces a new type parameter to the `VM` type that tags a given
instance with it's thread local state. Library users will now need to either use the ST moand and
`runST` or `stToIO` to compose and sequence vm executions.

## GHC 9.4

Hevm is now built with ghc9.4. While earlier compiler versions may continue to work for now, they
are no longer explicitly tested or supported.

### Other

- Contract balances can now be fully symbolic
- Contract code can now be fully abstract. Calls into contracts with unknown code will fail with `UnexpectedSymbolicArg`.
- Run expression simplification on branch conditions
- SLoad/SStore simplifications based on assumptions regarding Keccak non-collision&preimage
- Improved Prop simplification
- CopySlice+WriteWord+ConcreteBuf now truncates ConcreteBuf in special cases
- Better simplification of Eq IR elements
- Run a toplevel constant folding reasoning system on branch conditions
- Global config via a monad, which should allow for more refactoring
- `evalProp` is renamed to `simplifyProp` for consistency
- Mem explosion in `writeWord` function was possible in case `offset` was close to 2^256. Fixed.
- BufLength was not simplified via bufLength function. Fixed.
- Add and Mul are associative, let's use that to make Expr more canonical
- `VMOpts` no longer takes an initial store, and instead takes a `baseState`
  which can be either `EmptyBase` or `AbstractBase`. This controls whether
  storage should be inialized as empty or fully abstract. Regardless of this
  setting contracts that are deployed at runtime via a call to
  `CREATE`/`CREATE2` have zero initialized storage.

## Changed

- `hevm dapp-test` has been replaced with `hevm test --project-type DappTools`.
- `hevm test` no longer supports parsing solidity output in the combined json format.
- The default value for `--ask-smt-iterations` has been changed to 1
- The SMT solver is never queried for branch conditions that do not occur in a loop (as determined by the loop detection heuristic)

## Fixed

- `--max-iterations` is respected in cases where path conditions have become inconsistent
- `--max-iterations` is now respected for loops with a concrete branch condition

## Fixed

- Fixed a bug where underflow was possible when transfering eth

## [0.50.5] - 2023-04-18

## Changed

- The `--storage-model` parameter has been replaced with `--initial-storage`
- The `--smttimeout` argument now expects a value in seconds not milliseconds

## [0.50.3] - 2023-02-17

### Fixed

- `hevm symbolic` exits with status code `1` if counterexamples or timeouts are found
- Calldata reads beyond calldata size are provably equal to zero.

### Added

- Improved equivalence checker that avoids checking similar branches more than once.
- Improved simplification for arithmetic expressions
- Construction of storage counterexamples based on the model returned by the SMT solver.
- Static binaries for macos

### Changed

### Fixed

- `hevm exec` no longer fails with `hevm: No match in record selector smttimeout`
- the `gas`, `gaslimit`, `priorityfee`, and `gasprice` cli options are now respected

- we now build with ghc 9.2.4 by default
- various perf improvements for concrete execution ([#157](https://github.com/ethereum/hevm/pull/157), [#152](https://github.com/ethereum/hevm/pull/152))

## [0.50.0] - 2022-12-19

### Changed

The symbolic execution engine has been rewritten. We have removed our dependency on sbv, and now
symbolic execution decompiles bytecode into a custom IR, and smt queries are constructed based on
the structure of the term in this IR.

This gives us much deeper control over the encoding, and makes custom static analysis and
simplification passes much easier to implement.

The symbolic execution engine is now parallel by default, and will distribute granular SMT queries
across a pool of solvers, allowing analysis to be scaled out horizontally across many CPUs.

more details can be found in the [architecuture](../../architecture.md) docs.

### Removed

The following cli commands have been removed:

- `abiencode`
- `rlp`
- `flatten`

## [0.48.1] - 2021-09-08

### Added

- Support for 0.8.4 custom error types in stack traces

- Default `smttimeout` has been increased to 1 minute.
- A new flag has been added to hevm (`--ask-smt-iterations`) that controls the number of iterations
  at which the symbolic execution engine will stop eager evaluation and begin to query the smt
  solver whether a given branch is reachable or not.
- Contract fetching now happens asynchronously.

- Removed NoSuchContract failures

## 0.47.0 - 2021-07-01

## 0.46.0 - 2021-04-29

### Added

- Updated to Berlin! Conformant with GeneralStateTests at commit hash `644967e345bbc6642fab613e1b1737abbe131f78`.

### Fixed

- ADDMOD and MULMOD by zero yields zero.
- Address calculation for newly created contracts.
- Accomodated for the notorious "anomolies on the main network" (see yellow paper Appendix K for trivia)
- A hevm crash when debugging a SELFDESTRUCT contract.

## 0.45.0 - 2021-03-22

### Added

- Two new cheatcodes were added: `sign(uint sk, bytes message)` and `addr(uint sk)`. Taken together
  these should allow for much more ergonomic testing of code that handles signed messages.
- Symbolic execution can deal with partially symbolic bytecode, allowing for symbolic constructor arguments to be given in tests.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug in the abiencoding.
- Fixed the range being generated by ints.
- `hevm flatten` combines the SPDX license identifiers of all source files.

### Changed

- updated `nixpkgs` to the `20.09` channel

## 0.44.1 - 2020-02-02

### Changed

- hevm cheatcodes now accept symbolic arguments, allowing e.g. symbolic jumps in time in unit tests
- More efficient arithmetic overflow checks by translating queries to a more [intelligent form](www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/z3prefix.pdf).

## 0.44.0 - 2020-01-26

### Added

- `hevm` now accepts solidity json output built via `--standard-json` as
  well as `--combined-json`.
- addresses in the trace output are prefixed with `ContractName@0x...`
  if there is a corresponding contract and `@0x...` otherwise.

### Fixed

- Symbolic execution now generates calldata arguments restricted to the proper ranges,
  following the semantics of fuzzing.
- If the `--address` flag is present in `hevm exec` or `hevm symbolic`,
  it overrides the contract address at which a contract will be created.
- Address pretty printing
- Updated sbv to `8.9.5` to fix "non-const in array declaration" cvc4 issue with ds-test.

### Changed

- Use cvc4 as default smt solver

## 0.43.2 - 2020-12-10

### Changed

- The default smttimeout has been increased from 20s to 30s

## 0.43.1 - 2020-12-10

- Some symbolic terms are displayed with richer semantic information, instead of the black box `<symbolic>`.
- `hevm dapp-test` now supports symbolic execution of test methods that are prefixed with `prove` or `proveFail`
- The `hevm interactive` alias has been removed, as it is equivalent to `hevm dapp-test --debug`
- `hevm dapp-test --match` now matches on contract name and file path, as well as test name
- Step through the callstack in debug mode using the arrow keys

### Changed

- `dapp-test` trace output now detects ds-note events and shows `LogNote`
- create addresses are shown with `@<address>` in the trace
- `DSTest.setUp()` is only run if it exists, rather than failing
- support new ds-test `log_named_x(string, x)` (previously bytes32 keys)
- return arguments are fully displayed in the trace (previously only a single word)
- return/revert trace will now show the correct source position

## 0.42.0 - 2020-10-31

- optimize SMT queries
- More useful trace output for unknown calls
- Default to on chain values for `coinbase`, `timestamp`, `difficulty`, `blocknumber` when rpc is provided
- Perform tx initialization (gas payment, value transfer) in `hevm exec`, `hevm symbolic` and `hevm dapp-test`.

### Added

## 0.41.0 - 2020-08-19

### Changed

- Switched to [PVP](https://github.com/haskell/pvp/blob/master/pvp-faq.md) for version control, starting now at `0.41.0` (MAJOR.MAJOR.MINOR).
- z3 updated to 4.8.7
- Generate more interesting values in property based testing,
  and implement proper shrinking for all abi values.
- Fixed soundness bug when using KECCAK or SHA256 opcode/precompile
- Fixed an issue in debug mode where backstepping could cause path information to be forgotten
- Ensure that pathconditions are consistent when branching, and end the execution with VMFailure: DeadPath if this is not the case
- Fixed a soundness bug where nonzero jumpconditions were assumed to equal one.
- default `--smttimeout` changed from unlimited to 20 seconds
- `hevm symbolic --debug` now respects `--max-iterations`

### Added

- `hevm exec --trace` flag to dump a trace
- Faster backstepping in interactive mode by saving multiple snapshot states.
- Support for symbolic storage for multiple contracts

## 0.40 - 2020-07-22

- hevm is now capable of symbolic execution!

### Changed

As a result, the types of several registers of the EVM have changed to admit symbolic values as well as concrete ones.

- state.stack: `Word` -> `SymWord`.
- state.memory: `ByteString` -> `[SWord 8]`.
- state.callvalue: `W256` -> `SymWord`.
- state.caller: `Addr` -> `SAddr`.
- state.returndata: `ByteString` -> `[SWord 8]`.
- state.calldata: `ByteString` -> `([SWord 8], (SWord 32))`. The first element is a list of symbolic bytes, the second is the length of calldata. We have `fst calldata !! i .== 0` for all `snd calldata < i`.

- tx.value: `W256` -> `SymWord`.

- contract.storage: `Map Word Word` -> `Storage`, defined as:

```hs
data Storage
  = Concrete (Map Word SymWord)
  | Symbolic (SArray (WordN 256) (WordN 256))
  deriving (Show)
```

### Added

New cli commands:

- `hevm symbolic`: search for assertion violations, or step through a symbolic execution in debug mode.
- `hevm equivalence`: compare two programs for equivalence.

See the README for details on usage.

The new module `EVM.SymExec` exposes several library functions dealing with symbolic execution.
In particular,

- `SymExec.interpret`: implements an operational monad script similar to `TTY.interpret` and `Stepper.interpret`, but returns a list of final VM states rather than a single VM.
- `SymExec.verify`: takes a prestate and a postcondition, symbolically executes the prestate and checks that all final states matches the postcondition.

### Removed

The concrete versions of a lot of arithmetic operations, replaced with their more general symbolic counterpart.

## 0.39 - 2020-07-13

- Exposes abi encoding to cli
- Added cheat code `hevm.store(address a, bytes32 location, bytes32 value)`
- Removes `ExecMode`, always running as `ExecuteAsBlockchainTest`. This means that `hevm exec` now finalizes transactions as well.
- `--code` is now entirely optional. Not supplying it returns an empty contract, or whatever is stored in `--state`.

## 0.38 - 2020-04-23

- Make InvalidTx a fatal error for vm tests and ci.
- Suport property based testing in unit tests. [313](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/pull/313) Arguments to test functions are randomly generated based on the function abi. Fuzz tests are not present in the graphical debugger.
- Added flags `--replay` and `--fuzz-run` to `hevm dapp-test`, allowing for particular fuzz run cases to be rerun, or for configuration of how many fuzz tests are run.
- Correct gas readouts for unit tests
- Prevent crash when trying to jump to next source code point if source code is missing
